Hello All, 

I have created a simple Student Database Management System project in Python. It allows to add new students with their respective informations and store the data in a structured way using Pandas Library.

This is very helpful to learn about the basic programming concepts like functions and loops. Also, this predicts the use of Pandas Dataframe for data storage and manipulation.

How to use:
* Run the program using Python.
* Follow the menu to add or view student records.
* Data will be saved automatically when you exit the program.
